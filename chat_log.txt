Question: Why am I only approved even if I joined before reaching the max. no of participants?
Answer: The provided text doesn't contain any information about someone being approved for a quest despite joining before the maximum number of participants. It's possible the text is missing, or you are referring to something different. 

To help me understand, please provide the following information:

With more context, I can give you a more accurate and helpful answer.
